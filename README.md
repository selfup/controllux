# Controllux

### Mainly for fun:

1. you can now make your own controllers that handle different states
1. and each controller has it's own defined actions (set by you)
1. this helps namespace the flux api for your application (edited)

It is immutable by default, and follows the vanilla redux example (which subscribes to a simple render function that replace the innerHTML of a certain element)

### Example:

Here is an example on jsfiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/selfup/fq1k9vh4/
