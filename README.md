# Controllux

### Mainly for fun:

1. you can now make your own controllers that handle different states
1. each controller has it's own defined actions (set by you)
1. this helps namespace the flux api for your application
1. you can call the state from any controller if you need it at any point in time

***

It is immutable by default, and follows the vanilla Redux example (which subscribes to a simple render function that replaces the innerHTML of a certain element)
